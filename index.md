## About me: 
 - I'm from Rapid City, SD and I currently live here. My family is from the Sisseton Whapeton Dakota Oyate tribe. I choose to study civil and environmental engineering because I'd like to positively impact the current state of the environment and create more sustainable ways to operate as a society. I love nature and anything to do with outdoors activities, especially swimming. I also enjoy going to music festivals and shows. I fully believe that summer is the superior season. And I have two puppies whom are my entire world <3
